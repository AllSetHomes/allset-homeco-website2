# ALLSet Home Co. - Website Mockup (Vite + React + Tailwind)

This project is a multi-page React site (Vite) configured for dark modern styling and Netlify Forms.

## Quick start (if running locally)

1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Run dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Netlify
